**For YOU. Not for EVERYONE.**
**No nags. No noise. Just text.**

Ganpi is a macOS-native text editor built for one thing: making text do exactly what you intend.

No wizards. No hand-holding. No “smart” guesses getting between you and the page. Ganpi keeps the UI quiet, the editing predictable, and the response immediate—so you stay in control and in flow.

If you want an editor that puts editing first and everything else second, welcome.
